The purpose of this webpage is to have a space to showcase all my projects that I have created. This is so I can present it to a employer and obtain an interview for a web-developer job position. In order for me to be able to create a professional portfolio I need to design a webpage that has all my deployed webpage proyects in a library. The resulting html and css displayed will showcase my abilitites and tools learned so far as a web developer. The layout of the webpage must be user-friendly and appaeling to the eye, with transitions and a matching palette of colours. Also, it must be responsive so it works and looks well in any device resolution. 

Webpage code structure

For a while I have been learning how to use SASS, Gulp and Json in combination so I can access some tools such as: compiling multiple style and script pages automatically; minifying images whenever I add them to the repository folder; and mainly to access SASS to give style to this project. Because the purpose of this project is to create a portfolio that I can use for an interview I decided to incorporate as many tools as I could. Also, I feel really comfortable working with SASS. On the other hand, before the start of the bootcamp I made a folder which works as a template for new webpages that I've been using in all my projects created from scratch. This is why the second commit has so many changes, it was the cloning of this template. 

The gulpfile compiles all the src folder content into the build folder. There it combines all SASS into one CSS stylesheet that is the one linked to the index. This build folder also contains the compilation of all javascript pages and the images minified and copied from the src folder.

Webpage Content

The webpage contains a header section with a heading with my name followed by a photo and a navigation with shortcuts to all sections in the page. The heading also contains the cover image with a heading of a quote. Next is the main section containing an about me section with a brief summary of my career and a work section which showcases all the projects I have created. The first two proyects were created by own initiative and are not complete. The third one is a mini project made in the Boot Camp and the other two are just placheholders. Finally, at the end of the webpage is the footer which consists of the Contact Me section with a navigation bar containing links to my phone, email, Github and Linkedin.

The webpage contains several hover transitions and has a responsive design made with flexblox and grid to work correctly in different device resolutions.
